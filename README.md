# BESSEL'S CORRECTION PROVEN

<p> Basic script that proves Bessel's Correction theorem by plotting results with and without Bessel's correction and reporting the corresponding estimator biasedness. </p>

<p> Conclusion: for the analyzed dataset the difference of bias for std point estimate between the two approaches (with Bessel's correction and without it) is of 190.46 units ($) or 5x less acurate for a population std of 15,000 with 200 iterations.</p>

<p> Motive: just wanted to see the underlying logic behind one of most elementary statistics proofs. </p>
